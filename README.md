This is an early attempt to restyle [newsblur](https://www.newsblur.com). 

There is a [chrome extension (click to install)](https://github.com/qfwqfw/newsblur-css/raw/master/chrome.crx) that loads an [gh-pages hosted](https://github.com/qfwqfw/newsblur-css/blob/gh-pages/simple.css) version of the stylesheet. There are many issues that yet need to fixed. After that the stylesheet should be packed with the extension.
