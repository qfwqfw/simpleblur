This is an early attempt to restyle [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com). There is a [chrome extension (click to install)](https://github.com/qfwqfw/simpleblur/raw/master/chrome.crx) that loads a [gh-pages hosted](https://github.com/qfwqfw/simpleblur/blob/gh-pages/simple.css) version of the stylesheet. There are many issues that still need to get fixed, after that the stylesheet will be packed with the extension. You can take a look at [a screenshot](https://github.com/qfwqfw/simpleblur/blob/gh-pages/screenshot.png), too.
